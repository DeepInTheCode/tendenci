Membership Module
==================

#. The membership module handles a person's membership.  It allows people to become a member of your website and with that membership may come special privileges.  Such as discounts on attending an event or when posting a job.

#. Memberships are capable of expiring and people may be allowed to renew their membership and regain their privileges.

#. Every time someone becomes a member, a new membership record is created and this set of memberships is recorded. A new membership record can be created by joining the organization for the first time or renewing your membership.

#. This allows you to view the history of a person and the length of their membership with an organization.

#. It also helps determine gaps in a persons membershipship with the organization and how much they've contributed to the organization through membership fees


Membership
------------------

#. A membership record is an agreement between a user and your website.  This agreement may come at a cost to the user or be free.  Having a membership record on your website means that this person is now considered a "member."

#. A membership record mostly tells your website that this person is a "member."  A membership record could also hold custom information about that member.

#. All members have a membership of a specific type.  In fact a person can have multiple memberships all of different types.  A person cannot have multiple memberships of the same "membership type."
